## 1. PROJECT COSTS BREAKDOWN

### Labor Costs

| Role | Rate | Hours | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI Developers | $60/hour | 400 hrs | $24,000 |
| Security Analysts | $50/hour | 300 hrs | $15,000 |
| Web Developers | $55/hour | 350 hrs | $19,250 |
| **Subtotal (Labor)** | | | **$58,250** |

### Infrastructure & Supplies

| Item | Rate | Duration | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| AWS Cloud Services | $500/month | 6 months | $3,000 |
| **Subtotal (Supplies)** | | | **$3,000** |

### Miscellaneous Costs

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Training & Documentation | $2,000 |
| **Subtotal (Miscellaneous)** | **$2,000** |

---

## 2. TOTAL PROJECT COST

**TOTAL COSTS = $58,250 + $3,000 + $2,000 = $63,250**

## 3. BENEFITS ANALYSIS

### Annual Benefits Breakdown

| Benefit Type | Basis | Amount/Year |
|---|---|---|
| Cost Savings | 35% reduction in annual audit cost | $30,000 |
| Enhanced Revenues | New consulting contracts | $20,000 |
| Productivity Gains | Faster risk assessments (soft benefit) | $10,000 |
| Compliance Improvement | Better adherence to ISO/IEC 27001 | $5,000 |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL BENEFIT** | | **$65,000** |

---

## 4. PAYBACK PERIOD CALCULATION

**Formula:**
$$\text{Payback Period} = \frac{\text{Total Initial Cost}}{\text{Annual Benefit}}$$

**Calculation:**
$$\text{Payback Period} = \frac{\$63,250}{\$65,000} = 0.97 \text{ years}$$

**Result: Approximately 12 months**

This means the project will pay for itself within the first year of operation.

## 5. NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV) ANALYSIS

### NPV Formula
$$\text{NPV} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{B_t}{(1+r)^t} - C_0$$

Where:
- $B_t$ = Benefits in year $t$
- $r$ = Discount rate (8%)
- $C_0$ = Initial cost
- $n$ = Project lifespan (3 years)

### NPV Calculations

| Year | Annual Benefit | Discount Factor | Present Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | $65,000 | 1.08¹ = 1.0800 | $60,185 |
| Year 2 | $65,000 | 1.08² = 1.1664 | $55,735 |
| Year 3 | $65,000 | 1.08³ = 1.2597 | $51,600 |
| **Total Present Value of Benefits** | | | **$167,520** |

### NPV Calculation

$$\text{NPV} = \$167,520 - \$63,250 = \$104,270$$

**Result: NPV = $104,270 (Positive)**

This indicates the project is financially viable and will generate significant value over the 3-year period.
