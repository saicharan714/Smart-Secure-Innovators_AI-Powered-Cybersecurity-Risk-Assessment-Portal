## 🏗️ SLIDE 5: INTEGRATION - CHARTER + GITHUB + BASECAMP (1.5 minutes)
**Speaker: Sai Charan Nagilla**

### Slide Content:

**HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER**

**Charter → GitHub → Basecamp Flow:**

```
PROJECT CHARTER (Requirements & Approval)
    ↓
GITHUB REPOSITORY (Code Implementation)
    ↓
BASECAMP PROJECT MANAGEMENT (Progress Tracking)
    ↓
METRICS & REPORTING (Decision Making)
```

**Example: Feature Development Workflow**

1. **Charter Defines:** AI model must achieve >85% accuracy
   - Success metric documented in PROJECT_CHARTER.md
   - Assigned to Sai Charan (AI/ML Developer)

2. **GitHub Implements:** Feature branches for model development
   - Branch: `feature/ai-model-training`
   - Commits: Feature extraction, model training, evaluation
   - PR: Code review, tests pass, merge to develop
   - Documentation: Model architecture in code comments

3. **Basecamp Tracks:** Task progress and milestones
   - Basecamp Task: "Train ML Classifier - Target >85% Accuracy"
   - Status: In Progress (60% complete as of Nov 23)
   - Owner: Sai Charan Nagilla
   - Due Date: Dec 5, 2025
   - Updates: Weekly check-ins with accuracy metrics

4. **Metrics & Reporting:** Weekly status updates
   - Model accuracy: Currently 82% (trending toward target)
   - Code coverage: 92% (exceeds 90% requirement)
   - Schedule: On track for Dec 5 deadline
   - Risk status: Monitoring, no blockers

**Dashboard Integration:**
- **Charter KPIs** tracked in **Basecamp tasks** with updates pushed to **GitHub** commits
- **GitHub commits** trigger **automated tests** that report to **Basecamp**
- **Basecamp check-ins** pull status from **GitHub metrics** (commits, test results, coverage)
- **Weekly reports** synthesize data from all three systems

**Team Communication:**
- Charter updates → Email announcement + GitHub wiki + Basecamp docs
- Code changes → GitHub PR notifications + Basecamp activity feed
- Status updates → Basecamp check-in + GitHub milestone progress
- Issues/blockers → Basecamp message board + GitHub issues

### Speaker Notes:
"The beauty of this integrated approach is that we're not managing three separate systems—we're using them together. The charter sets expectations, GitHub implements and tracks code, Basecamp coordinates the team, and metrics flow between all three. If something changes in the charter, we update GitHub documentation and Basecamp tasks. If we hit a blocker in code, we flag it in Basecamp and GitHub simultaneously. It's a seamless workflow that keeps everything aligned."
