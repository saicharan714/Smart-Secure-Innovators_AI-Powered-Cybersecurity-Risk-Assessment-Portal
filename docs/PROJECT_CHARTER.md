## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Problem or Issue
Organizations increasingly struggle with manual, inconsistent, and resource-heavy cybersecurity audits. With cyberattacks rising, the lack of automation leads to slow response times and increased security vulnerabilities.

### Purpose of Project
This project aims to create an AI-driven cybersecurity assessment portal that automates vulnerability detection, prioritizes risk levels, and generates remediation recommendations — reducing manual workload and increasing accuracy.

### Business Case
Modern security audits cost organizations significant time and money. Automating 80% of the assessment process will:
- Reduce annual audit expenses
- Accelerate compliance efforts
- Improve detection of high-priority vulnerabilities
- Enhance trust and readiness for cybersecurity threats

The system is expected to yield measurable cost savings and improved operational efficiency.

### Goals / Metrics
1. Automate 80% of vulnerability assessments
2. Reduce manual review time by 50%
3. Improve detection accuracy to 95%
4. Deliver first pilot deployment within 4 months

### Expected Deliverables
- Updated Project Charter & Report
- AI-based vulnerability classification model
- Web-based cybersecurity risk assessment portal
- Real-time risk visualization dashboard
- Training and user documentation
- GitHub repository with setup instructions
- Presentation slides
- Testing logs and risk management documentation

## FINANCIAL SUMMARY / BUSINESS CASE

### Payback Period Analysis
$$\text{Payback Period} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Annual Benefit}} = \frac{63,250}{65,000} = 0.97 \text{ years} \approx 12 \text{ months}$$

### Net Present Value (NPV) Analysis
**Assumptions:**
- 3-year benefit period
- Discount rate: 8%

$$\text{NPV} = \sum \frac{\text{Benefit}}{(1+r)^t} - \text{Initial Cost}$$

**Calculations:**
- Year 1: $65,000 ÷ 1.08 = $60,185
- Year 2: $65,000 ÷ 1.08² = $55,735
- Year 3: $65,000 ÷ 1.08³ = $51,600
- Total PV of benefits = $167,520
- **NPV = $167,520 – $63,250 = $104,270**

### Non-Financial Considerations
- Improved brand reputation
- Increased client confidence
- Stronger compliance positioning
