• **Dashboard Module Role**
  - Bridges AI model outputs to real-time visualization

  - Sets up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (automated testing)
  - Manages AWS infrastructure (EC2, RDS, S3, CloudFront)
  - Enables continuous integration & deployment

### Without This Role:
  - ❌ No architecture = components incompatible
  - ❌ No backend API = frontend has nowhere to send data
  - ❌ No database = data lost on shutdown
  - ❌ No DevOps = cannot deploy to production

### Evidence:
  - System architecture approved Nov 20 ✅
  - 12 API endpoints designed & specified ✅
  - PostgreSQL schema complete & optimized ✅
  - GitHub Actions CI/CD running on every commit ✅
  - Docker containers configured ✅

## ✅ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### KEEP ALL 3 TEAM MEMBERS

• **Sai Charan Nagilla** - KEEP
  - Irreplaceable: Project manager + AI/ML specialist
  - Removing: Project fails (no management + no AI model)
  - Status: ESSENTIAL ✅

• **Pranav Dara** - KEEP
  - Irreplaceable: System architect + backend + database + DevOps
  - Removing: System won't work (no backend, no database, can't deploy)
