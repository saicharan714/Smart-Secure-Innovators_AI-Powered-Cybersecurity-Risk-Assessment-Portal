## 👤 SAI CHARAN NAGILLA
### Project Manager & AI/ML Developer

**Why Keep:** ESSENTIAL - 3 Critical Roles

| Role | Justification | Evidence |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **Project Manager** | Coordinates 6-month project, manages $63,250 budget, leads weekly standups, ensures deadline compliance (Apr 10, 2026) | Charter approved Oct 31, Basecamp check-ins every Monday |
| **AI/ML Developer** | Develops vulnerability classifier (core system intelligence) - must achieve >85% accuracy by Dec 5 | Current: 82% accuracy, 60% complete, scikit-learn model in GitHub |
| **Dashboard Module** | Bridges AI outputs to real-time visualization; enables security teams to see risk data | Flask backend + React frontend integration active |

**Cannot Remove Because:** Without project management = chaos/missed deadline. Without AI model = system fails (defeats entire purpose). Without dashboard = results are invisible.

**Hours:** ~290 hrs | **Status:** 60% complete ✅

## 👤 PRANAV DARA
### System Architect & Backend Developer

**Why Keep:** ESSENTIAL - 4 Critical Roles

| Role | Justification | Evidence |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **System Architect** | Designs microservices connecting React ↔ Flask ↔ PostgreSQL ↔ AI Model; enables all components to work together | Architecture approved Nov 20, 12 endpoints designed |
| **Backend API** | Implements 12 REST endpoints for scanning/reporting/auth; processes requests and manages data flow | 5/12 endpoints implemented, Flask server running |
| **Database** | Stores vulnerabilities, users, scan results, audit trails; ensures data persistence and performance | PostgreSQL schema complete, optimized indexes configured |
| **DevOps/CI-CD** | Docker containerization, GitHub Actions automation, AWS deployment; enables production readiness | Docker + GitHub Actions configured, auto-testing enabled |

**Cannot Remove Because:** Without architecture = components incompatible. Without backend API = frontend has nowhere to send data. Without database = no data persistence. Without DevOps = cannot deploy to production.

**Hours:** ~290 hrs | **Status:** 50% complete ✅

## 👤 SANDEEP REDDY MANTHENA
### Frontend Developer & Security Specialist

**Why Keep:** ESSENTIAL - 4 Critical Roles

| Role | Justification | Evidence |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **Frontend Developer** | Builds React web app (user interface); security teams need this to access system | 8/20 React components implemented, responsive design active |
| **UI/UX Design** | Creates intuitive dashboard, scan interface, reports view; ensures usability and adoption | Material-UI design system, <2 sec load time target |
| **Security Implementation** | JWT authentication, RBAC access control, HTTPS encryption, input validation; protects vulnerability data | JWT auth in React, RBAC component checking configured |
| **AWS Deployment** | Deploys frontend to AWS EC2/CloudFront; ensures production uptime >99.5% | Frontend deployment scripts ready, CloudWatch monitoring configured |

**Cannot Remove Because:** Without frontend = system unusable (nobody can access it). Without UI/UX = poor adoption. Without security = vulnerability data exposed (security liability). Without deployment = system stays development-only.

**Hours:** ~280 hrs | **Status:** 40% complete ✅

## 📊 QUICK COMPARISON

| Dimension | Sai | Pranav | Sandeep | Why All 3 Needed |
|-----------|-----|--------|---------|------------------|
| **Unique Skills** | AI/ML/PM | Backend/DevOps | Frontend/Security | No overlap, all different |
| **Workload** | 290 hrs | 290 hrs | 280 hrs | Balanced, fair distribution |
| **Critical Path** | AI Model ✅ | Backend ✅ | Frontend ✅ | All on critical path |
| **Can Be Replaced?** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | Each irreplaceable |
| **Project Success?** | Vital | Vital | Vital | Need all three to succeed |

---

## ✅ FINAL VERDICT

**KEEP ALL 3 TEAM MEMBERS - They are ALL essential.**

- **Sai:** No project management or AI model = project fails immediately
- **Pranav:** No backend architecture or database = system doesn't function
- **Sandeep:** No frontend or security = system unusable and insecure

Removing any one person = project cannot succeed.
