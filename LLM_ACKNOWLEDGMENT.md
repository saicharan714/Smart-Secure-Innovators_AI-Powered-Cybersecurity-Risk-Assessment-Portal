## How LLM Was Used (Original Thinking & Problem-Solving)

### Our Original Thinking:

1. **Project Requirements Analysis:**
   - Reviewed final project submission requirements from course rubric
   - Identified key deliverables: GitHub repo, documentation, README, 3 commits
   - Determined repository naming convention: team-name_project-name

2. **Documentation Strategy:**
   - Organized project charter into structured sections
   - Calculated financial metrics (payback period, NPV) with proper formulas
   - Identified critical path activities for project timeline
   - Prioritized documentation in Markdown for GitHub compatibility

3. **Technical Architecture:**
   - Designed folder structure for AI model, web app, dashboard, and tests
   - Planned tech stack based on project requirements (AI/ML, web portal, real-time dashboard)
   - Structured for scalability and team collaboration

4. **Process Implementation:**
   - Developed git workflow with three meaningful commits
   - Created comprehensive setup instructions for cross-platform compatibility
   - Ensured all deliverables met academic rubric requirements

### LLM as Tool, Not Solution:

- **Input:** Our project requirements, data, deadlines, and team information
- **Processing:** LLM helped format and structure our information professionally
- **Output:** Well-organized documents that we reviewed and validated
- **Responsibility:** All outputs have been reviewed and are accountable to the team and instructor
